Do you use social media?
Twitter, Discord... etc. wow...

Now, we normal doing like 'wake up, then lie in bed check social media messages.'

Ref [1]
From Digital 2024 Australia, the Australians aged 16 to 64, the average daily time on social media is 1 hour and 51 minutes. For teenagers 16-25 years old, this number will be higher.

Do you have this happen? 
"I am doing something, but on other side, the social media page is opened."
(What do you think? it is belong “time on social media”?)

The negative effects on social media is from "no limit use time"
I call it the “Social media progress bar”
Ref [2] [3]
"1~2 hour: Acceptable, not affect timetable."
"> 3 hour: Get dependencies, anxiety and tension feel be increase."
"> 4 hour: Loss of sleep time, which mean 100% health damage."

In fact, 80% of the time on social media we do "useless things", like short videos etc, while communication only get 20%.
